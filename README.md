# quiniela-mundial-2026

This project was created with [Better-T-Stack](https://github.com/AmanVarshney01/create-better-t-stack), a modern TypeScript stack that combines React, TanStack Router, Convex, and more.

## Features

- **TypeScript** - For type safety and improved developer experience
- **TanStack Router** - File-based routing with full type safety
- **TailwindCSS** - Utility-first CSS for rapid UI development
- **Shared UI package** - shadcn/ui primitives live in `packages/ui`
- **Convex** - Reactive backend-as-a-service platform
- **Authentication** - Better-Auth
- **PWA** - Progressive Web App support

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

## Convex Setup

This project uses Convex as a backend. You'll need to set up Convex before running the app:

```bash
bun run dev:setup
```

Follow the prompts to create a new Convex project and connect it to your application.

Copy environment variables from `packages/backend/.env.local` to `apps/*/.env`.

Then, run the development server:

```bash
bun run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) in your browser to see the web application.
Your app will connect to the Convex cloud backend automatically.

## UI Customization

React web apps in this stack share shadcn/ui primitives through `packages/ui`.

- Change design tokens and global styles in `packages/ui/src/styles/globals.css`
- Update shared primitives in `packages/ui/src/components/*`
- Adjust shadcn aliases or style config in `packages/ui/components.json` and `apps/web/components.json`

### DESIGN.md references

The repo includes `awesome-design-md/` as a git submodule with reference `DESIGN.md` files you can use for UI direction.

- Browse available design systems in `awesome-design-md/design-md/*`
- Copy the `DESIGN.md` you want to use into the project root when you want the agent to follow that visual language

### Add more shared components

Run this from the project root to add more primitives to the shared UI package:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add accordion dialog popover sheet table -c packages/ui
```

Import shared components like this:

```tsx
import { Button } from "@quiniela-mundial-2026/ui/components/button";
```

### Add app-specific blocks

If you want to add app-specific blocks instead of shared primitives, run the shadcn CLI from `apps/web`.

## Deployment (Cloudflare via Alchemy)

- Dev: cd apps/web && bun run alchemy dev
- Deploy: cd apps/web && bun run deploy
- Destroy: cd apps/web && bun run destroy
